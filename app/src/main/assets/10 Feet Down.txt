[Ruelle:]
Cold nights, cold nights, long night
Staring down at an empty cup like
I'ma fill, I'ma fill it up
All night, all night
Ten feet down nearly my whole life
But I'll be rising, rising up

[NF:]
Yeah I know the person in the mirror's not a perfect one
I look at him every day and think he's not enough
My life's a book that I don't really like to open up
I'm twenty-six, but I feel like I live in chapter one
I skim through, I've been through it, they laugh at us
You think it's funny, yeah, laugh it up
I always felt like no one listened to me, that's how I grew up
Church is where I found God, but it's also where I learned to judge
Yeah, I had to learn there's a difference between
What you want, and what you really need
I've always been motivated by comments from people tellin' me
Things they think I'll never be, and then I become it, this is my everything
There's so much that goes on in my head that people will never see
You'll probably be terrified of my memories, don't lecture me
Let me be, let me see, let me breathe, how they remember me
Doesn't alter who I am as a person to take my energy, yeah

[Ruelle:]
Hot days, cold nights
Staring down at an empty cup like
I'ma fill, I'ma fill it up
All day, all night
Ten feet down nearly my whole life
But I'll be rising, rising up
Cold nights

[NF:]
Yeah, my fans made me who I am, but they also deceived me
I've been allowed to live life like I'm already grieving
I'm at a table of lies, but don't eat what they feed me
My hoodie over my face, so nobody can see me
I'm on a plane, 'bout to fly again
Looking out the window, take a moment to admire it
Wondering how high it is, wonder where the time has went
Then I shut the window and go back to feeling like I'm out my mind again, ah!
Yeah, seems like we're all trying to climb a ladder
It's crazy what we'll do to climb it faster
It's like we throw away the things in life that really matter
Just so that we can make it to the top, and wonder we're even climbing after
I know the feeling of feeling like everything you deal with will never change
That's part of being a human, yeah
Life's what you make of it, take it, embrace it, and take it, and savor it
Ain't about what you did, it's what you became from it, ah!

Hot days, cold nights
Staring down at an empty cup like
I'ma fill, I'ma fill it up
All day, all night
Ten feet down nearly my whole life
But I'll be rising, rising up
Cold nights

We all want what we never had
The good life doesn't seem so bad
The good life doesn't seem so sad
Yeah we all want what we never had

Hard days, cold nights
Staring down at an empty cup like
I'ma fill, I'ma fill it up
All day, all night
Ten feet down nearly my whole life
But I'll be rising, rising up
Cold nights

We all want what we never had
The good life doesn't seem so bad
The good life doesn't seem so sad
Yeah we all want what we never had

Hot days, cold nights
Staring down at an empty cup like
I'ma fill, I'ma fill it up
All day, all night
Ten feet down nearly my whole life
But I'll be rising, rising up

Cold nights, cold nights, long night
Staring down at an empty cup like
I'ma fill, I'ma fill it up
All night, all night
Ten feet down nearly my whole life
But I'll be rising, rising up
