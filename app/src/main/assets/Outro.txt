I'm dedicated, the definition of dedication
Wrote this whole record while I was levitating
Sittin' in my room with the pen and paper, I'm innovative
They've been afraid of me since I was a second grader
I'm the kid on the playground momma told you to never play with
There's levels of music - and I'm in the elevator
Going up to the top floor, look how we elevated
But you don't know the brand by now, you better get educated
Take both of my arms, rip 'em out of sockets and seperate 'em
Forgive me, yeah, I know I get animated
Don't matter, I still write a better record than yours without a hesitation
Never been more motivated
Just look at all the minds I've opened and penetrated
See, I am the voice of all these kids that think things but never say 'em
That's why they come to my shows wearing the NF hoodies and hats low like we're carrying weapons
Put the controllers away, it's game over
I promise I'm way colder
The fans keep saying that they're hungry for new music, well that's pretty convenient because I just made a plate for 'em
And now I'm hearing none of y'all are saying
I just sit at the keys feeling the music
Got me thinking I'm Beethoven
The game needs a makeover
If you've been waiting, the wait's over
You ain't notice, y'all about to witness a takeover, I'm home!
Yeah, they waiting on me to match that
The emotion I had in the last one
But if I don't, they gonna tell me that I'm losing my passion
If I do am I repeating my actions?
Yeah, look, "How Could You Leave Us" is massive
There ain't nothing I can write that'll match that
My biggest fear writing this record wasn't putting out trash
It was disappointing myself and the fanbase
Now I want you to picture me
I'm in a hotel rapping, crying on the floor of the bathroom
Staring in the mirror, my room, hand shaking playing "How Could You Leave Us" through the speakers on my iPhone
Trying to figure out if I'ma always feel the way that I feel
Or maybe someday I can learn to be happy
Or maybe I can't be, 'cause if the music ain't emotional enough are they gonna call me a has-been?
Pain's always been the root of my music
If I cut it off, how am I supposed to keep growing
If I let it go, won't my whole career be in ruins?
That's when I realized this whole conversation is stupid
I never cared to impress people that don't even know me
I just write what I feel, somehow it started a movement
Trying to enjoy a career but I don't know how to do it
When I spend all of time my being afraid I'ma lose it
But then I figured out the reason they follow me
The reason the why these fans surrounding me
It's not 'cause I'm a "Rap God"
I don't need you people to bow to me
All they ever did was doubted me, now everyone's proud of me
Acknowledge me or not, you ain't ignoring the following
I'm just teaching 'em something they couldn't learn in they colleges
This is for the kids feeling like they live at the bottom and every day of they lives looks like it's darker than Halloween
Yeah, you ain't alone out there, look around you—we got a lot of fans in here
Couple hundred thousand, that's what we did last year
Listen to Intro 3, trying to kill my fear
They'll get that in a minute
We about to shatter the critics
I am a savage admit it
A lot of baggage I live in
That's why the passion is different
Really don't care if they get it
We're only three records in it, and this is just the beginning
I'm home!

Real music...
