[Verse 1:]
Wait, wait, wait
Don't leave me
Wait, wait, wait
Don't leave me
Where you going? Where you going?
Why you leaving?
(Wait)
I can't lose you, I can't lose you
God I need You, God I need You
(Wait)
And don't you love me? Don't you love me?
Guess you don't want me, you don't want me
(Wait)
We back and forth, yeah, this ain't working, this ain't working
Love ain't perfect, love ain't perfect

[Hook:]
I'm holding on to pieces of us
That I just can't let go
I know this is a desperate kind of love
But it feels like it's home
Where you going? (Where you going?)
I'm holding on to pieces of us
Cause I just can't let go

[Verse 2:]
Wait, wait, wait
Don't leave me
Wait, wait (wait)
What you thinking? What you thinking?
Where's your mind at?
(Wait)
Don't you miss us, don't you miss us
Cause you don't call that, you don't call that
(Wait)
Are you happy? Tell me are you happy?
Are you smiling? Are you smiling?
(Wait)
Girl what happened? Tell me, girl what happened?
Cause I am dying, I am dying

[Hook:]
I'm holding on to pieces of us
That I just can't let go
I know this is a desperate kind of love
But it feels like it's home
Where you going? (Where you going?)
I'm holding on to pieces of us
Cause I just can't let go

[Verse 3:]
We don't wanna have a conversation
We don't wanna think about it, we wanna just fake it
We just wanna act like everything is great
Go back to the day watchin' movies in the basement
And the problem is now I'm feeling like everything is changed
And I'm trying to make a livin' on the music
But I feel like every time I look at you I'm in a place
It's hard to be the man of the house when you ain't gotta house (I hate this)
It's complicated, it's complicated
We don't wanna talk, it's complicated
I'm sitting in the hotel room like, "Why?"
Call your phone and apologize
There's gotta be a way we can make this right
We can make this right

[Hook:]
I'm holding on to pieces of us
That I just can't let go
I know this is a desperate kind of love
But it feels like it's home
Where you going? (Where you going?)
I'm holding on to pieces of us
Cause I just can't let go

[Outro:]
I'm holding on to pieces of us
That I just can't let go
I know this is a desperate kind of love
But it feels like it's home
Wait, wait, wait
Don't leave me
Wait, wait, wait
Don't leave me
